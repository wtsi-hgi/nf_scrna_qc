# Description

This pipeline performs data QC and transcription profile clustering for droplet single cell RNA-seq. It starts from gene transcript UMI (unique molecular identfier) counts per barcoded cell. Cell-type assignments for PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) are also generated.

- [running tests](docs/README-tests.md): run pipeline locally on a small test dataset
- [potential problems and workarounds](docs/README-workarounds.md)
- [input files](docs/README-inputfiles.md)
- [output directory structure](docs/README-outputfiles.md)
